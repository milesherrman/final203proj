1) I placed executeActivityAction() in the Action class because most of the function was acting on an action object

2) I also placed executeAnimationAction() in the Action class, because some of the function was acting on an action object, but I almost placed it in the EventScheduler class instead.

3) I placed moveEntity() into the Entity class because all the other methods that call moveEntity were in the entity class already, but I feel like it couldâ€™ve worked in WorldModel as well.
